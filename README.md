## Welcome to the Marito GitHub Page

You can use the [official webpage](https://marito.co.za) to find out more information about the project.

Marito is a large lexicographical engine for South African vernacular languages. The engine has a collection of various AI and statistical models built solely for these languages. We use the engine for a variety of purposes, including spellchecking, paraphrasing and editing vernacular documents. The domains range from general, to financial and medical terminologies, and everything in between.

### Phase 1: Marito Dictionaries

For phase 1 of the project, we are using the engine to produce large bilingual dictionaries. These dictionaries cater for beginner to advanced users who either know English and seek to learn or use vernacular languages or vice versa. The marito engine allows for the calibration of the dictionaries to match specific target audiences.

Take a look inside the dictionaries below:

- Sotho
- Tswana
- Swati
- Xhosa
- Zulu
- Ndebele

### Phase 2: Mongwaledi writing assistant

For phase 2 of the project, we allow users to engange with a writing assistant software called Mongwaledi. This is a text editor that assists users of South African languages to gain access AI powered spellcheckers, grammar correction, paraphrasing and other essential features for a powerful writing experience.
